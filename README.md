Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are one of the lead- ing causes of death worldwide. Therefore, it is important to have a reliable, affordable and accurate system that can diagnose heart disease on time in order to provide efficient treatment before it can lead to severe complications resulting in heart attack. Using major health conditions of patients, various machine learning approaches are used to predict the presence of heart disease. We seek to assess the performance of six machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression, Decision trees, K Nearest Neighbor approach (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost and XGBoost, for model prediction. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy with SVM model having the best accuracy. Finally, an explainable approach based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is implemented to generate explanations of the model’s decisions.
This project assessed the performance of six machine learning models to predict the occurrence of heart disease and then compares the accuracy of the models and obtained SVM with highest accuracy of 89%.
Explainable AI was implemented using SHAP to explain feature importance and generate explanations of the model’s decision.
